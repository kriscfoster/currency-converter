# Currency Converter Challenge

Develop a protected currency converter web application using a public currency converter API
(e.g. https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free, https://currencylayer.com/documentation).
The application should have a login/registration page and a main page to query historical or
current exchange rates.

After successful login, the application should show the most recent 10
queries and their results on the main page as a reminder. Some main currencies e.g. EUR, USD, GBP,
NZD, AUD, JPY, HUF, etc are enough.
